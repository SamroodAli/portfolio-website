        <p> TLDR: I am a CA turned software engineer</p>
        <p>
          Since childhood, I always wanted to become a Chartered Accountant (CA)
          - I was drawn to the prestige and financial rewards that came with the
          profession. However, as I delved deeper into my studies, I realized
          that this career path didn't bring me the happiness or fulfillment
          that I had hoped for. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I saw it as an
          opportunity to re-evaluate my goals and passions and consider a career
          change. As I researched different options, I saw my cousin working for
          Microsoft, and my interest in software engineering was sparked. I had
          loved programming and technology as a child, and seeing my cousin work
          on projects from home reignited that passion. I began to explore the
          field more deeply, and found that a career in software engineering was
          possible without a degree, as long as I had the necessary skills and
          experience.

          I taught myself how to code. I still remember going through "Head
          First Kotlin: A Brain-Friendly Guide". I don't remember Kotlin though.
